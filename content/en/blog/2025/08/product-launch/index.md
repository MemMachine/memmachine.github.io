We're incredibly excited to pull back the curtain and officially launch **MemMachine**, a project we believe will fundamentally change how developers build and interact with AI agents. Today, we're making MemMachine available to everyone – from individual developers to large enterprises – offering a robust, flexible, and open-source solution for true agent intelligence.

## **The Challenge: Forgetful Agents**

If you've built AI agents using popular frameworks, you've likely encountered a common frustration: your agents forget. They struggle with long-term context, personalized interactions, and building upon past conversations. While existing memory solutions offer pieces of the puzzle, a comprehensive, multi-layered system has been elusive... until now.

## **Enter MemMachine: Memory, Reimagined**

MemMachine is designed to be the missing memory layer for your AI agents. It provides:

1. **Short-Term Memory (Working Memory):** For immediate conversational context. Think of it as the agent's working memory, allowing fluid, natural dialogue within a single interaction.
2. **Long-Term Memory (Persistent Memory):** For recalling facts, procedures, and general knowledge over extended periods. This enables agents to learn and retain information across sessions and users.
3. **Personalization Memory:** This is where MemMachine truly shines. Agents can remember user-specific preferences, interaction history, and unique facts, leading to deeply personalized and intuitive experiences.

## **Key Features at a Glance**

- **Open Source:** Full transparency and flexibility. Deploy it yourself, inspect the code, and contribute to its evolution.
- **Multi-layered Architecture:** Go beyond basic conversation buffers with dedicated layers for different memory types.
- **Seamless Integration:** Designed to work with popular agent frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph, enhancing their capabilities without reinvention.
- **Granular Data Control:** Securely connect to your existing data silos (Notion, Slack, databases, etc.) and precisely control what your agent remembers and forgets.
- **Scalability & Persistence:** Built for production, ensuring your agents' memories are robust and available when needed.

## **The Vision: Truly Intelligent AI**

Our goal with MemMachine is to empower developers to build AI agents that are not just reactive, but truly *intelligent*. Agents that understand context, learn from interactions, adapt to individual users, and retain knowledge like a human. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for customer service, personalized assistants, internal tools, and much more.

## **Get Started Today!**

Whether you're an individual developer experimenting with AI or an enterprise looking to deploy sophisticated agents, MemMachine has a plan for you:

- **Open Source:** Dive into the code, self-host, and build. (*Available today*)
- **Enterprise:** On-premise deployment, custom SLAs, and dedicated support for maximum control and security. (*Coming Soon!*)
