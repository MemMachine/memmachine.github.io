- question: What is MemMachine, and what makes it unique?
  answer: MemMachine is an open-source, multi-layered memory system for AI agents. It allows you to equip your agents with Short-Term, Long-Term, and Personalization memory. While many AI models offer some form of built-in memory, MemMachine's system is model-agnostic, meaning it can support multiple AI models simultaneously, including specialized models hosted in a private cloud or on-premises data center. This capability enables organizations to maintain full control of their data and work with various models without vendor lock-in.

- question: Why are these capabilities needed if they're becoming available by frontier labs like OpenAI?
  answer: Because a frontier lab's memory service keeps the memory, and its memory service does not work with other models. Many organizations work with multiple models, including specialized models deployed in its private environment, including its VPC in the cloud and its own on-prem data center.  They desire a memory system that can support all of these models.

- question: How does MemMachine handle data privacy and security?
  answer: MemMachine is designed with security in mind. The open-source version can be deployed in your private cloud or on-premises environment, giving you full control over your data.

- question: Who is driving development of MemMachine?
  answer: The project was initially incubated by MemVerge to its current state. The project is now community-driven, and we welcome contributors of all backgrounds. MemVerge will continue to assign its engineering team to improve the memory system and support community efforts.
